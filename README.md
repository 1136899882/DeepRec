# DeepRec
In this repository, we implement many recent deep learning based recommendation models with Tensorflow.




# Implemented Algorithms
We implemented both rating estimation and top-n recommendation models.
* AutoRec (www'15)
* CDAE (WSDM'16)
* NeuMF (WWW'17)
* CML (WWW'17)
* LRML (WWW'18) (DRAFT ONLY, testing will come soon)
* etc.

You can run this code from Test/testItemRanking.py or Test/testRatingPred.py

# Requirements
* Tensorflow 1.7+, Python 3.5+, numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas

# To do
* Add more models
* Different Evaluation Protocals
* Code Refactor
